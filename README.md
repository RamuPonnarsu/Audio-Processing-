The audio processing project aims to enhance and analyze audio signals using advanced techniques. Leveraging Python libraries such as librosa and NumPy, the project involves tasks like audio feature extraction, noise reduction, and pitch modulation. Additionally, machine learning algorithms, particularly deep learning models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), may be employed for tasks such as speech recognition or emotion detection from audio. The project contributes to fields like speech processing, music analysis, and human-computer interaction. Ultimately, this audio processing project seeks to advance our understanding and manipulation of audio data for diverse applications, ranging from voice-controlled systems to automated music tagging and sentiment analysis through sound.
